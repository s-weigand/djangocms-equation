Python Source Documentation
===========================

Documentation of the Python source code.
The auto generated Documentation mainly contains methods and attributes
which are inherited from the corresponding classes of ``django-cms``,
but since the actual source code is very short you can just click the
``[source]`` link on top of each class.
The auto generated documentation of the inherited classes is given to give
insight on the actual finished objects.
